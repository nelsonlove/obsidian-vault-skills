# Spec: frontmatter tree model

Replaces folder/Johnny-Decimal-derived structure with an explicit **frontmatter tree**.
A note declares its `type` and a single `parent`; the exporter builds a strict tree,
validates its edges, and compiles it into the wired Claude Code plugin (each agent owns
its skills; `root → … → leaf` delegation). Folders become purely organizational.

## Discovery

- A note is a candidate iff frontmatter `type` ∈ {`skill`, `agent`, `policy`}.
- Location in the vault is irrelevant to structure.

## Frontmatter fields

| Field | Req | Applies | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | **yes** | all | `skill`, `agent`, or `policy`. |
| `parent` | no¹ | all | A **single** `[[wikilink]]` to the parent **agent**. Omit ⇒ parent is the root. A **list ⇒ error** (strict single parent). For a `policy`, `parent` scopes where it applies (see Compilation). |
| `root` | no | agent | `true` marks the one root agent. |
| `description` | rec | both | Trigger text. |
| `name` | no | both | Base name override (default: filename slug). |
| `id` | no | both | Name-prefix override, e.g. `56` → `56-<slug>`. Default: no prefix. |
| `label` | no | both | Display label used in breadcrumbs (default: name). |
| `tools` | no | agent | Tool allowlist; `Agent` appended automatically if it has child agents. |
| `model` | no | agent | Model. |
| `version` | no | skill | Skill version. |

¹ Omitting `parent` means "child of the root" — it is not an error.

## Tree construction

1. Parse candidates into nodes keyed by note path.
2. Resolve each `parent` wikilink to a target note **path** (Obsidian resolves; the pure
   transform receives resolved paths).
3. **Root** = the node with `root: true`. If none → **synthesize** a `vault` root agent
   (level 0). If more than one → error on the extras, first wins.
4. Each non-root node's parent = its resolved parent node, or the root if `parent` omitted.
5. **Level** = distance from root (root = 0). Not declared; computed.

## Strict single parent + shared-skill rule

- `parent` must resolve to **exactly one agent**. A list, or multiple resolutions, is an
  **error** (node skipped + warning).
- There is **no multi-parent**. To share a skill across agents, give it **no parent** ⇒ it
  lands at **level 0**, owned by the root. Level-0 skills are universal: preloaded into the
  root and globally invokable by any agent (a plugin's skills are a global namespace). This
  is the *only* sharing mechanism — single-parent structurally enforces it.

## Validation pass

Errors skip the node and warn; warnings advise.

1. **Resolves** — unresolved `parent` wikilink ⇒ error.
2. **Parent is an agent** — parent resolves to a skill ⇒ error.
3. **Single parent** — list / >1 resolution ⇒ error.
4. **One root** — 0 ⇒ synthesize; >1 ⇒ error on extras (first wins).
5. **Acyclic** — a cycle in the parent chain ⇒ error (cycle members skipped).
6. **Depth ≤ 5** — an agent at level > 4 ⇒ warn (delegation past the depth-5 nested-subagent
   cap won't spawn). Skills don't count toward depth.
7. **Reachable** — a node whose chain doesn't reach the root ⇒ error.

## Compilation

- **Name** = `id ? "<id>-<slug>" : "<slug>"` of `name || filename`, deduped (`-2`, `-3`, …).
- **Breadcrumb** = `label`s of ancestor agents from just-below-root down to the parent,
  joined ` › ` (omitted at level ≤ 1). **Description** = `[<breadcrumb>] <rawDesc>`.
- **Skill** → `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (global namespace).
- **Agent** → `agents/<name>.md`:
  - `skills:` = namespaced refs (`<plugin>:<name>`) of skills whose parent is this agent.
  - `tools` = authored tools (+ `Agent` when it has child agents).
  - Delegation set = agents whose parent is this agent.
  - Body += a **Vault access** line (vault path), any applicable **policy** bodies (see
    below), a **Skills** note (what's preloaded), and a routing section — **Vault routing**
    for the root, **Delegates to** for others — listing children by label.
- **Synthesized root**: name `vault`, generic router body, owns level-0 skills, delegates
  to level-1 agents.

### Policy notes (shared context)

A `type: policy` note is not emitted as a file. Its `parent` is resolved like any node's
(single wikilink to an agent; omit ⇒ root). Its body is injected into the prompt of **every
agent in its parent's subtree** (root ⇒ all agents). For each agent, applicable policy
bodies are gathered along its ancestor-or-self chain, root-most first, and appended after
the Vault-access line. Validation: multiple parents, an unresolved parent, or a parent that
isn't a valid agent ⇒ error (the policy is dropped).

## Removed vs. the JD model

`scope`, JD path parsing, area/category terminology, the levels/regex config, and
`delegates-to` (superseded by `parent`). The tree is fully defined by `parent` + `root`.

## Depth note

Levels 0–4 = agent depths 1–5 below the main conversation = exactly the nested-subagent
cap. Level 4 is the deepest that still spawns; deeper agents preload/exist but can't be
reached by live delegation.
