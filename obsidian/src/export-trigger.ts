// Export-on-save trigger.
//
// Renaming a skill/agent/policy note makes Obsidian emit a *burst* of metadataCache
// "changed" events — the file rename itself, plus a cascaded `[[wikilink]]` rewrite in
// every child note whose `parent:` pointed at the old name. Exporting on each event would
// validate a half-rewritten tree: a child's `parent` link still resolves to the pre-rename
// basename (now missing), so the transform reports a spurious `unresolved parent` error and
// drops the child from the output. Debouncing collapses the burst into a single export once
// the cache has settled and every cascaded link rewrite is done, so validation always runs
// against the consistent post-rename tree.
